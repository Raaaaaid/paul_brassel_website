# My first web application using Flask

This repository contains a fun project to get to know the web framework and *Python* package
[*Flask*](https://flask.palletsprojects.com). This project does not pursue any goals. I just want to build a web-based
user interface for some of my *Python* scripts and implement some random ideas so that I also get more used to write
websites with *HTML*, *CSS* and *JavaScript*. You can check out the live version at
[paulbrassel.de](https://paulbrassel.de).
